    text: "I can't thank Tho enough for helping me go from zero experience to landing my first dev job in just six months. His mentorship was exactly what I neededâ€”he broke down complex concepts, guided me through interview prep, and gave me the confidence to tackle real-world coding challenges. Tho doesn't just teach you how to code; he teaches you how to think like a software engineer and approach problems with a professional mindset. If you're serious about breaking into tech or are an experienced developer looking to improve your skills, Tho is the mentor you are looking for!",
